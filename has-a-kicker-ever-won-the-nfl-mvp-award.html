While quarterbacks and running backs have traditionally dominated the MVP conversation, there have been instances where players from other positions have made their mark. One such unique occurrence happened in the 1982 NFL season, when Mark Moseley, a kicker for the Washington Redskins (now the Commanders), defied the odds and became the first and only kicker to win the prestigious MVP award. This article explores the extraordinary achievements of Mark Moseley and delves into the history of non-traditional MVP winners in the NFL.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Unforgettable 1982 Season: In the 101-year history of the NFL, the 1982 season stands out as one of the strangest. Amidst various peculiar events, the most remarkable aspect was undoubtedly the MVP award going to a kicker. Mark Moseley, a straight-on kicker, emerged as an unlikely contender for the coveted title. Prior to the 1982 season, Moseley had a relatively average career, but that year, he displayed exceptional accuracy and consistency. Making 20 of 21 field-goal attempts, he almost single-handedly won games for the Redskins. Despite his struggles in the playoffs, Washington managed to secure the Super Bowl victory. Moseley's remarkable performance in 1982 marked the end of an era for straight-on kickers in the NFL.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Moseley's MVP Triumph: Mark Moseley's MVP win in 1982 was a significant milestone in NFL history. As the first and only kicker to receive the award, he shattered the conventional belief that the MVP was exclusively reserved for offensive skill players, particularly quarterbacks and running backs. Moseley's remarkable accuracy and clutch performances made him a deserving recipient of the prestigious honor. His success proved that kickers, often overlooked in the MVP conversation, could have a profound impact on a team's success.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Non-Traditional MVP Winners: While kickers rarely find themselves in the running for the MVP award, there have been other non-traditional winners who have left a lasting mark. Desmond Howard, a kick/punt return specialist, won the MVP award in 1997. Howard's electrifying returns and game-changing plays made him a standout performer throughout the season. His selection as the MVP demonstrated that players specializing in special teams can have a significant impact on the outcome of games.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Defense Shining Bright: In the history of the NFL, only two defensive players have ever won the MVP award. Alan Page in 1971 and Lawrence Taylor in 1986 showcased their exceptional skills and dominance, transcending their respective positions. Their ability to disrupt offenses and change the course of games made them stand out among their peers. The recognition of defensive players as MVP winners highlights the importance of defensive excellence in the game of football.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Breaking the Quarterback Trend: Since Adrian Peterson's MVP win in 2012, quarterbacks have dominated the MVP landscape, winning the award in most subsequent seasons. However, the recognition of Peterson, a running back, emphasized that exceptional performances from non-quarterbacks could not be ignored. This acknowledgement provided a glimmer of hope for players in positions other than quarterback, reminding fans and analysts alike that MVP-worthy performances can come from various areas of the field.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>While the MVP award in the NFL has historically been dominated by quarterbacks and running backs, there have been instances where players from other positions have risen to the occasion and left an indelible mark. Mark Moseley's remarkable achievement as the first and only kicker to win the MVP award in 1982 shattered conventional beliefs and showcased the impact kickers can have on a team's success. With the recognition of non-traditional MVP winners like Desmond Howard and defensive stalwarts Alan Page and Lawrence Taylor, the NFL continues to evolve, acknowledging the contributions of players from diverse positions and backgrounds. The MVP award serves as a testament to the exceptional talents that transcend traditional positions and shape the course of football history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6hmKxlkWK4qq%2FKnqlmnaaav27DzqdkraCVYrunuIymrallkayus7A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhas-a-kicker-ever-won-the-nfl-mvp-award.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhas-a-kicker-ever-won-the-nfl-mvp-award.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhas-a-kicker-ever-won-the-nfl-mvp-award.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhas-a-kicker-ever-won-the-nfl-mvp-award.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhas-a-kicker-ever-won-the-nfl-mvp-award.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhas-a-kicker-ever-won-the-nfl-mvp-award.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marcus-jordan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marcus-jordan.html>Marcus Jordan- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bernard-ambrosino-obituary.html>Bernard Ambrosino Obituary: Remembering Bernard Ambrosino Master Chef At Silver Fox Steakhouse, Casp</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bernard-ambrosino-obituary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
