In my view, we need to see pain in the economy.

My comments were deeply insensitive to employees, tradies, and families across Australia who are affected by these cost-of-living pressures and job losses.</p><p>“I want to be clear: I do appreciate that when someone loses their job it has a profound impact on them and their families and I sincerely regret that my words did not convey empathy for those in that situation.”</p><p>Gurner previously sparked national headlines in 2017 when he accused younger workers of spending too much money on smashed avocados.</p><p>“When I was trying to buy my first home, I wasn’t buying smashed avocado for $19 and four coffees at $4 each,” he said.</p><p>“This generation is watching the Kardashians and thinking that’s normal — thinking owning a Bentley is normal.”</p><p>Mr Gurner has also previously told Forbes Australia in an exclusive report that he’s “tried everything” in his own life to boost productivity and wellness including IV drips, infra-red saunas, and psychedelic mushrooms.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Gurner apologized after his remarks sparked international condemnation and claimed the millionaire lacked empathy for workers and that his views were “disgusting.” <span class=credit>Financial Review</span></figure><p>“From micro-dosing mushrooms to infra-red saunas to steam to Oura, lymphatic drainage. Everything.
