Chow first gained international fame and a reputation as a distinctly kind-hearted and noble action hero with John Woo’s seminal Hong Kong gangster thriller A Better Tomorrow (1986).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Woo became one of the most sought-after action directors in the world as a result of the movie, which at the time set all box office records in China. Other popular action movies starring Chow and Woo include A Better Tomorrow II (1987), The Killer (1989), and Hard Boiled (1992).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>During the height of the Hong Kong film industry, from 1976 to 1995, Chow produced nearly 70 films and was nominated for 12 Hong Kong film awards (he won three).

Along with Woo, who relocated to Los Angeles in 1992 to pursue a career in Hollywood, Chow also became a cult figure in the United States. Reservoir Dogs, the writer-director Quentin Tarantino’s 1992 first film, is said to have been partially inspired by Chow’s 1987 picture City on Fire.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Two years after starting his English studies, Chow made his American acting debut in the action movie The Replacement Killers, which also starred Mira Sorvino. The movie was only moderately successful, but critics gave his next feature, a police drama named The Corruptor (1999), a higher review. With his portrayal of King Mongkut in the adaptation of the 1946 classic Anna and the King of Siam, alongside Jodie Foster, Chow ventured outside of the shoot-’em-up genre in late 1999.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chow appeared in the critically acclaimed Chinese action movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, directed by Ang Lee, in 2000 opposite martial arts icon Michelle Yeoh.
