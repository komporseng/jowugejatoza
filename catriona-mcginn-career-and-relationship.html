Paul, her spouse, gained notoriety for his performance in Saved by the Bell as a young actor. Gosselaar even took home the Young Artist Award for his performance.</strong></p><h2><span id=How_Much_Is_The_Net_Worth_of_Catriona_McGinn>How Much Is The Net Worth of Catriona McGinn?</span></h2><p>Her current net worth as of 2022 is $3 million. Given that Catriona holds a senior role in her company, this information should come as no surprise.</p><p>Additionally, Mark, McGinn’s spouse, is worth $8 million in total. The four members of the family dwell in Santa Clarita Valley.</p><h2><span id=Wiki-Bio_of_Catriona_McGinn_Gosselaar_An_Account_of_Her_Early_Years>Wiki-Bio of Catriona McGinn Gosselaar: An Account of Her Early Years</span></h2><p>On June 22, 1978, Catriona Hope McGinn was born in Canada. Following her marriage to American Mark, she obtained dual citizenship with the United States and Canada. She is of Irish descent and is a member of the Caucasian ethnic group.</p><p>Her parents raised the famous wife in Canada. Due to her extreme privacy, not much information about her parents and siblings is available.</p><h2><span id=Gosselaar_Catriona_McGinn_Education>Gosselaar, Catriona McGinn Education</span></h2><p>In 1998, after graduating from high school, Catriona enrolled at McGill University to pursue a bachelor’s degree. In 2002, she obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Communication. Her majors were in Cognitive & Child Psychology and Media Studies.</p><p>After that, Canadian student AD Catriona attended Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. She studied advertising, public relations, and applied communication at the college.</p><p>Considering her educational background, it’s reasonable to assume Catriona is highly intelligent. The fact that Catriona consistently prevails in their debates should go without saying.</p><h2><span id=Is_Catriona_McGinn8217s_Career_As_An_Actress_As_Her_Spouse>Is Catriona McGinn’s Career As An Actress As Her Spouse?</span></h2><p>Fans of the attractive heartthrob Mark assumed Catriona would work as an actor or model when they saw him propose to her. McGinn, though, has a completely different history.</p><p>She had worked as an advertising executive before marrying Mark. In case you didn’t know, the person in charge of advertising campaigns is called an advertising executive. By creating a successful advertising plan, it is their responsibility to assist in boosting the sales of their clients’ companies.</p><p>Catriona began her work as an editor at New Canadian Magazine in the beginning. She then worked at SparkNet Communications as an operations manager from 2003 until 2006. Catriona held the position of General Manager at The Nielson Company from 2006 to 2010.</p><p>She worked at a few dead-end jobs before discovering her calling at Paskal Lamour. She began working for the company in 2010 and has held the positions of Director of Sales & Marketing and Co-Founder ever since. In addition, she is employed with Jeff Lewis Design as an Associate in Interior Design.</p><p>It is clear from the brief overview of her work background that she is a complex person. It makes sense why Mark was drawn to this driven woman.</p><h2><span id=Catriona_McGinn8217s_Marriage_to_Mark-Paul_Gosselaar_Made_Her_Famous>Catriona McGinn’s Marriage to Mark-Paul Gosselaar Made Her Famous</span></h2><p>On July 28, 2012, Catriona and Gosselaar exchanged vows. A source told PEOPLE magazine that the stunning wedding was held at the Sunstone vineyard in Santa Ynez, California.</p><p>In an interview with the magazine, Mark discussed his role in the wedding. “I’m too type-A to let it happen around me,” he remarked. We’re attempting to keep it as conventional as we can. It’s going to be enjoyable!</p><p>“We are going to eat our ass a––es off,” the Saved By the Bell star continued. We’re very enthusiastic about that component.</p><p>August 2011 harked the beginning of the couple’s engagement. With a stunning 5-carat cushion-cut diamond ring, the Franklin & Bash star proposed to this special someone. Neil Lane, a friend of Mark’s, created the band on demand.</p><p>He couldn’t wait to pop the question, according to a source at the time of his engagement. Upon discovering the woman of his dreams, he was ecstatic.</p><h2><span id=Maternal_Catriona_McGinn_has_two_children>Maternal Catriona McGinn has two children.</span></h2><p>Their two children were an integral part of their marriage and could not be overlooked. On September 30, 2013, the stunning model gave birth to her first child, a son called Dekker Edward Gosselaar. “We are ecstatic to have our new family member. At that moment, Mark exclaimed, “We are incredibly in love with our little child.</p><p>On February 17, 2015, Catriona gave birth to their second child together, a daughter they named Lachlyn Hope Gosselaar, around 16 months after the birth of their first child.</p><p>Overall, Mark tweeted after the birth of his fourth child (two from a prior relationship), saying, “So in love with our new baby girl.” Mom and child are doing well and content. Two sons and two girls—too ideal!</p><p>Despite Catriona having two children of her own, her husband Mark has two children from a prior relationship.</p><h2><span id=What_About_Catriona8217s_Previous_Marriages_Mark_Gosselaar_her_husband_was_previously_married>What About Catriona’s Previous Marriages? Mark Gosselaar, her husband, was previously married?</span></h2><p>As many of you may already be aware, Mark was previously wed to the stunning Lisa Ann Russell. On August 26, 1996, the ex-flames got married in a small ceremony. The couple reportedly initially crossed paths in the 1990s.</p><p>The couple’s connection resulted in the birth of two lovely children. On January 31, 2004, Michael Charles Gosselaar, their eldest child, was born in Los Angeles. In 2006, a few months after the birth of their first child, they brought Ava Lorenn Gosselaar into the world.</p><p>The four kids that Mark has are quite close to one another. Despite having different moms, the children have a bond that is comparable to that of biological ones.</p><p>However, Catriona had never been married before Mark.</p><h2><span id=spouse_Gosselaar_Mark-Paul>spouse Gosselaar, Mark-Paul</span></h2><p>Having grown up in Panorama City, Actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar, 48, is a well-known figure in Hollywood.
