<time>16 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p style=text-align:left>It was the year 2018 when actor Angus Cloud was discovered by an HBO casting agent for&nbsp;Euphoria while walking the streets of New York City, where he lived and worked at a chicken-and-waffles restaurant.</p><p style=text-align:left>With no plans to pursue acting professionally, Agnus was rather preparing to move back to his home in Ireland <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>but luckily he had studied Theatre at California’s Oakland School for the Arts.</span></p><p style=text-align:left>Fast forward to today, star in the making Agnus’ romance life has become a hot topic of discussion amongst Euphoria viewers; as his character, Fezco continues to receive cheering in the second season.</p><p>So a lot happened for Agnus’ character this season (premiered 9 January 2022) on Euphoria. Fans especially loved his grandmother’s (actor Kathrine Narducci) backstory. And among others, they loved to see Fezco take an unexpected romantic interest in Lexi (actor Maude Apatow) at a New Year’s party; leaving some to even wonder if these costars are dating in real life.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Are Euphoria Stars Maude Apatow And Agnus Cloud Dating IRL?</strong></h3><p>However, even the undeniable on-screen chemistry does not seem to be enough. That is, yes, Agnus Cloud and Maude Apatow are not likely going out in real life.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Maude Apatow And Agnus Cloud On-Screen Romance</strong></h3><p>“Neither of them have had a serious crush, because Lexi is busy with school and Fezco is running a business,” Agnus Cloud recently told Bustle of his and Maude Apatow’s characters budding romance. “When they find each other, something just clicks, and they learn a lot from each other because they’re from different worlds.”</p><p>And when E! News reached out to the Knocked Up star, her reaction to her character getting eyes for a bad guy was “I think she is like so fascinated by him, cause he is so sweet but also so bad. She is drawn to him.” Maude said this laughing and agreeing to the reporter that the same thing would be likely impossible for her in real life. Because, when it comes to dating in real life she cannot get anything past her mamma Leslie Mann.</p><p>As you know, Maude is the daughter of celebrated comedy director/producer Judd Apatow and actress Leslie Mann. Kudos to them, Maude got to pursue acting at a very young age.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>What Is Maude Apatow’s Current Relationship Status?</strong></h3><p>Many have also linked Maude Apatow with another Euphoria costar Lukas Gage. The two have rumored more and longer than Maude and Agnus have been talked about.</p><p>Fans started noticing Maude and Lukas together a little more frequently during Euphoria Season 2. But their romance rumors were a thing even before November 2021.</p><p>First started to become friends when filming for both Assassination Nation and Euphoria together. Their first photo together was in March 2017. Reportedly, the two became fast friends after they made Assassination Nation, and it carried over to Euphoria.</p><p>But, at the time, they were indeed just friends. Because Maude was in a relationship with British talent manager Charlie Christie.</p><p>Maude and Charlie started dating in 2018 and continued their relationship well into the pandemic. During this time, both Maude and Lukas would post photos of one another with captions that proved they were just friends. Maude even called Lukas her “BFF”.</p><p>But after she broke up with Charlie, fans believe, Maude and Lukas to have become something more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/are-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl-2022-1-300x237.jpg><p>And with time they only seemed to have gotten closer. As on his Instagram Lukas has blurred the lines between being just friends and engaging in a romance with Maude. He used to do the same back when he was dating Emma Dumont and other exes.</p><p>Be that as it may, the two never confirmed their relationship, and also they did not publically engage themselves in any romantic PDA.</p><p>There was a time when Maude was reportedly romantically entwined with co-star Jacob Elordi, but that has long since passed.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>What Is Agnus Cloud’s Current Relationship Status?</strong></h3><p>The more Agnus Cloud and Maude Apatow’s on-screen romance hit among the <a href=#>Euphoria</a> fans, the more their relationship status is discussed.</p><p>But let us tell you that, unlike Maude, Agnus did not seem to be dating anyone.</p><p>Even when his social media pages featured a few glimpses into his personal life, none of them suggested him dating a woman. Agnus, who attended the high school together with his future Euphoria castmate Zendaya, mainly posts shots from his magazines and fashion campaigns, as well as behind-the-scenes from Euphoria.</p><p>Agnus, so you know, studied Production Design at the Oakland School for the Arts. Before that, he was born in Oakland, California. Meanwhile, his family is from Ireland.</p><p>He celebrates his birthday on the 10th of July. So, on this day in 2021, he turned 23 years old.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmqqVYq6outSsZJykn6qxbq3NnWSmmaWZsm6tz5qrqK9dma61tc2gZKKqnGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fare-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fare-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fare-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-agnus-cloud-and-maude-apatow-dating-irl.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./becky-hammon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./becky-hammon.html>Becky Hammon Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Divorce, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./93317-shaquille-oneals-daughter-stuns-black-to-html.html>Shaquille O'Neal's daughter stuns in black top and ripped pants, looking like her mom in new pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./93317-shaquille-oneals-daughter-stuns-black-to-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
