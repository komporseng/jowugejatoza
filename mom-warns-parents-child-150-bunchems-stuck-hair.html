"I'm not that mom [who's] going to blame the toy company and [say], 'Poor me' ... this has happened to a lot of other people."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">In a statement to "GMA," Spin Master said they've spoken to Hoelzle about the incident.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We have been in contact with this customer and have expressed our sincere apologies for the inconvenience this has caused for both her and her daughter," Spin Master said. "While the packaging clearly indicates that Bunchems should be kept away from hair, we recognize that accidents like this may happen. We are no longer producing this item and encourage parents who may have the item in their home to read the directions carefully and leverage our online resources to help guide play with the product."</p><p><h2 class="KuBv lFzl GbVC HkWF HfYh kGyA SwCr">Editorâ€™s Picks</h2></p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said that on Jan. 8, her twins, Noah and Abigail, had finished up virtual learning and headed downstairs to play in the basement.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said she has several activity toys from her days as a preschool teacher and one is Bunchems -- small, plastic balls that stick to each other. She said she had no idea that if children played with Bunchems, they should be closely supervised -- especially children who are in the same age group as her kids.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Bunchem toys have thin legs that can be bunched, connected, coiled or stacked, according to Spin Master, which is located in Canada. Some creation packs are targeted to ages 4 and up, while other kits are recommended for ages 6 and up.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>Spin Master's website</a> has a page dedicated to Bunchems. Under the page's general information section, the company lists safety warnings including, "do not put Bunchems in hair," "keep Bunchems away from pets" and "do not eat Bunchems."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">And printed on the front of Bunchem boxes is: "Caution: Keep away from hair. May become entangled. Keep away from pets."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said that while she was cleaning up the kitchen, Noah and Abigail came upstairs to show her that Abigail had gotten Bunchem toys stuck in her hair.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"I kind of was in a state of shock," Hoelzle said. "I was looking at it like, 'How am I going to get these out?'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/bunchems-stuck-hair-ht-01-np-210204_1612451740367_hpEmbed_3x4_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said the kids told her that Noah was joking around and dumped the bucket of Bunchems over his sister's head.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">According to Hoelzle, the toys were matted in Abigail's hair and the kids said they attempted to remove the Bunchems themselves before asking Hoelzle for help.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Spin Master told "GMA" it stopped manufacturing the item in 2019. The company did not specify if and when the toy will be pulled off store shelves where it's currently still being sold as well as on e-commerce sites.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said that immediately after the incident she called Spin Master and filed a customer complaint. She said she later received an email apology and then a phone call from a company representative.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/bunchems-stuck-hair-ht-03-np-210204_1612451740369_hpEmbed_3x4_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"She was super nice on the phone, took down my name and I suggested as a mother, 'Maybe you want to talk to a group of moms on how to market it better,'" Hoelzle said. "There's warning labels on the front and I know that covers you legally, but not morally."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Spin Master's site also has a link which reads, "How do I untangle Bunchems from hair?" That link leads to a <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=#>video tutorial</a> on how to remove Bunchems from hair.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We recommend using conditioner or vegetable oil, and combing directly below the Bunchems to help them slide down the hair," Spin Master's site says. "The time required for this process can vary in length depending on the hair texture."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/bunchems-stuck-hair1a-ht-ml-210204_1612453696597_hpMain.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said she attempted the demonstration, though it did not work on Abigail's hair.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">After Hoelzle posted her story on Facebook, some as far as Australia and New Zealand sent her photos of Bunchems stuck in their own hair and in their pets' hair, she said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said her husband Dan Hoelzle and mother Jean Tschirlig both helped trying to remove the Bunchems. It was ultimately a hairdresser's suggestion of mineral oil and a shower cap with a towel wrapped around Abigail's head for 25 minutes that eventually did the trick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/bunchems-stuck-hair-ht-02-np-210204_1612451740368_hpEmbed_8x11_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said she used a large de-tangling comb and eventually all the Bunchems were removed.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Hoelzle said she took Abigail to a hair salon for a cut. There, professionals determined there wasn't any serious damage to the little girl's hair.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">As for Abigail, Hoelzle said she was a trooper throughout the process.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">"That's all part of miracle with this," Hoelzle added. "She was so great about it and she is the kid that doesn't like to get her hair brushed."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCTrHpmf5mdnrm6e8yopGavkae7tHnPmqmepqSoeqS0yKWbZmllZXqjwc2cn56lo2LAtcHCpGShmZmnfLTAzquweKGUcoR2gpdpZ2tw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmom-warns-parents-child-150-bunchems-stuck-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmom-warns-parents-child-150-bunchems-stuck-hair.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmom-warns-parents-child-150-bunchems-stuck-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmom-warns-parents-child-150-bunchems-stuck-hair.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmom-warns-parents-child-150-bunchems-stuck-hair.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmom-warns-parents-child-150-bunchems-stuck-hair.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./clue.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./clue.html>Clue (Movie) Cast - All Actors and Actresses</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./laura-fraser.html>Laura Fraser</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./laura-fraser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
