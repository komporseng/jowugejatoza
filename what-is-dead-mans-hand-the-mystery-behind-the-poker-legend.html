One of the most famous and intriguing stories in poker history is the one of the dead mans hand. What is dead mans hand, and why is it so notorious? In this article, we will explore the origin, meaning, and legacy of this legendary poker hand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Origin of the Dead Mans Hand</h2><p>The dead mans hand is a poker hand consisting of two black aces and two black eights. The name comes from the fact that this was the hand that the legendary Wild Bill Hickok was holding when he was shot and killed in 1876.</p><p>Wild Bill Hickok was a lawman, gambler, gunslinger, and folk hero of the American Old West. He was known for his exploits in fighting outlaws, arresting criminals, and winning poker games. He was also a friend of famous figures like Buffalo Bill Cody, Calamity Jane, and General George Custer.</p><p>On August 2, 1876, Hickok was playing a game of five-card stud poker at Nuttal and Mann’s Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. He usually preferred to sit with his back to the wall, but on that day, the only available seat was facing the door. As he was playing, a man named Jack McCall entered the saloon and approached Hickok from behind. McCall pulled out a revolver and shot Hickok in the back of the head, killing him instantly.</p><p>According to some accounts, Hickok’s final hand was two pair, aces and eights, all in the black suits. The fifth card, known as the kicker, is unknown, but some sources claim it was the queen of clubs, the nine of diamonds, or the five of diamonds. The hand became known as the dead mans hand, and has been associated with bad luck and death ever since.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Meaning of the Dead Mans Hand</h2><p>What is the significance of the dead mans hand, and why is it considered unlucky? There are several possible explanations for this.</p><p>One is that the hand represents the four horsemen of the apocalypse, as described in the Book of Revelation. The four horsemen are War, Famine, Death, and Pestilence, and they are said to bring destruction and chaos to the world. The aces and eights could symbolize the four horsemen, and the black suits could represent the darkness and evil that they bring.</p><p>Another explanation is that the hand is a reminder of the violent and unpredictable nature of the Old West. The death of Hickok was a shocking and tragic event that marked the end of an era. The hand could represent the dangers and risks that the pioneers and adventurers faced in their quest for fortune and glory.</p><p>A third explanation is that the hand is simply a coincidence, and has no inherent meaning or power. The hand is just a random combination of cards, and the fact that Hickok was holding it when he died was a matter of chance. The hand could have been any other hand, and it would not have changed the outcome of the situation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Legacy of the Dead Mans Hand</h2><p>Regardless of the meaning of the dead mans hand, the fact is that it has become a part of poker lore and culture. The hand has been featured in many books, movies, TV shows, songs, and games related to poker and the Old West. Some examples are:</p><ul><li>The 1926 book Wild Bill Hickok: The Prince of Pistoleers by Frank Wilstach, which popularized the story of Hickok’s death and the dead mans hand.</li><li>The 1936 film The Plainsman, starring Gary Cooper as Hickok and Jean Arthur as Calamity Jane, which depicts Hickok’s death and the dead mans hand.</li><li>The 1958 song The Ballad of the Dead Man’s Hand by Johnny Cash, which tells the story of Hickok’s death and the dead mans hand.</li><li>The 2004 TV series Deadwood, starring Ian McShane and Timothy Olyphant, which portrays the life and death of Hickok and the dead mans hand.</li><li>The 2006 video game Call of Juarez, which features a character named Reverend Ray, who carries a deck of cards with only aces and eights, and uses them as weapons.</li></ul><p>The dead mans hand is also a common motif in poker merchandise, such as cards, chips, clothing, and jewelry. Many poker players avoid holding or playing the hand, believing that it will bring them bad luck or doom. Others embrace the hand, seeing it as a challenge or a tribute to Hickok.</p><p>The dead mans hand is one of the most fascinating and mysterious aspects of poker history. It is a hand that has a story, a meaning, and a legacy. It is a hand that raises the question: what is dead mans hand, and what does it mean to you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfrLWiwIyiqmaclZaxbrnAp6pmoJGjsW7Ax55kprGjqbKzxYybnKGhnpl6tbTEZqeoo5Wneq2xxp6lnWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-dead-mans-hand-the-mystery-behind-the-poker-legend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-dead-mans-hand-the-mystery-behind-the-poker-legend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-dead-mans-hand-the-mystery-behind-the-poker-legend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-dead-mans-hand-the-mystery-behind-the-poker-legend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-dead-mans-hand-the-mystery-behind-the-poker-legend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-dead-mans-hand-the-mystery-behind-the-poker-legend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bernie-taupin-htm.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bernie-taupin-htm.html>Bernie Taupin - Bio, Age, net worth, height, Wiki, Facts and Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./braun-strowman.html>Braun Strowman Wiki, Height, Age, Wife, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./braun-strowman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
