After the grand success of the first season of the show, Netflix renewed it for a second season and the first two episodes of the 2nd season are already out! The first episode of the show welcomed 11 contestants (5 boys and 6 girls), all of whom were looking to find one. Kim Han-bin is one of the cast members of Single’s Inferno Season 2. Learn about him in the article below.</p><h3><strong>Kim Han-bin On Single’s Inferno</strong></h3><p>In case you have forgotten how the show works, at first, all the participants are dropped off in Inferno. There, they are left to make connections. If two singles like each other, they pair up and can escape to Paradise, spending the night in a luxury hotel where they have the chance to explore their relationship. However, there’s one twist. None of the contestants know anything about each other besides their names–not even their ages or jobs.</p><p>The 1st episode of the show introduced viewers to 11 contestants. They are Shin Seul-ki, Park Se-jeong, Choi Jong-woo, Lee So-e, Jo Yoong-jae, Lee Nadine, Kim Han-bin, Shin Dong-woo, and Choi Seo-eun.</p><p>In the first episode itself. the contestants met each other for the first time as they came out one by one. Like the previous season, the contestants then began cooking their own means from scratch.</p><p>Kim Han-bin managed to swoon many viewers in only two episodes in which he appeared. Many fans found Kim to be really cute. “I like Kim Han-bin the most of the boys so far, he totally won me over with his attitude, he’s cute and super cheerful,” one of his fans wrote.</p><p>Also, Kim quickly became the resident chef on the show as he took the initiative and showed impressive knife skills while cutting white radish. Rumors have it that Kim could be an actual chef like Moon Se-hoon in the 1st season of the show, who was revealed toward the very end of the show to be a professional chef and the owner of a restaurant.</p><p>Kim started off his journey in Single’s Inferno strong with his positive energy and even helped to break the ice when the contestants first gathered. However, it seems like his spirited personality did not work in his favor as he did not get any postcards at the end of the first episode.</p><p>Many online media claimed that Kim gave off more of a bestie vibe than a boyfriend vibe. He had chosen Choi Seo Eun with the reason being that she worked really hard when they were preparing dinner and also because the two talked and laughed a lot during the cooking process.</p><p>Not making any connection certainly left him heartbroken. He did his best to show no emotion as he sarcastically said, “I swept all the votes? Not even close… I didn’t think it would be as low as zero votes because I worked pretty hard and I was satisfied with that. I didn’t expect this.”</p><h3><strong>Is Kim Han-bin Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>At the time of this writing, we did not know if Kim Han-bin was dating anyone.</p><p>That being said, Kim is definitely trying though. He has appeared in multiple videos about dating for the YouTube channel Look Gating, which has 743 thousand followers on the platform.</p><p>Look Gating is a blind date channel that helps singles connect with one another. The show helps the contestant decide on their partner on the basis of looks or personality. In one of the channel’s videos, we saw Yunsun Lee choos3 Kim on the basis of his personality.</p><h3><strong>Kim Han-bin Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly born in the year 1958, Kim’s age was 24 as of December 2022.</p><h3><strong>Kim Han-bin Job</strong></h3><p>Moon Se-hoon was the chef for Single’s Inferno Season 1. It was revealed at the end of the season that he was a professional chef and he actually owned a restaurant.</p><p>The cycle seems to repeat in Single’s Inferno Season 2&nbsp; as he has already become the resident chef on Single’s Inferno Season 2. His incredible skills with the knife made everyone think if he is indeed a professional chef.</p><p>While we don’t know that just yet, we know that he graduated high school in 2019. On September 17, 2019, Kim took to Instagram to share one of his graduation pictures and captioned it, “Finally graduating from Hogwarts ..”</p><h3><strong>Is Kim Han-bin On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>Kim Han-bin is super popular on Instagram as he has over 93 thousand followers on his <a href=#>@domestic_seal</a> Instagram account. Almost all of his IG posts are photos of him, some of which are from his trips and some from his daily life.</p><h3><strong>Kim Han-bin Height</strong></h3><p>Kim stands at a towering height of 6 feet 1 inch.
